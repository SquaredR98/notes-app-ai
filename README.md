## AI Usage

## AI Features in Smart Notes App
The Smart Notes App integrates free and powerful AI services to enhance the note-taking experience:

1. Summarization
Powered by: OpenRouter (GPT-3.5) with fallback to DeepAI

    Triggered manually by the user via a "üß† Summarize" button

    Returns a short, AI-generated summary of the note content

    Immediately saved with the note in localStorage

2. Sentiment Detection
Powered by: Hugging Face (DistilBERT SST-2)

    Analyzes the tone of the note and assigns an emoji mood:

    üòä Positive

    üòû Negative

    üòê Neutral

3. Smart Title Generation
Custom logic extracts a meaningful title from the first sentence or line of the note

    Triggered automatically on save if no title is provided
